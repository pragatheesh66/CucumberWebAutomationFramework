*********************** Below are the improvements that could be considered to develop a more strong er framework***********

* JIRA integration can be done on framework to automatically update the test case status through script
* Parallel execution can be Implemented to speed up the execution
* External reports can be used such as Extent reports and Allure reports for detailed reporting
* Test data can be handled from external files such Excel or CSV which is independent of scripting and maintanence could be more easier
* Error or failures can be handled using Listerners which gives us a clear idea to come up with solutions
